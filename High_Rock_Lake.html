  <p>High Rock Lake is a reservoir located on the Yadkin River in central North Carolina in the counties of Davidson and Rowan. Built in 1926-27 by the Tallassee Power Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the
    lake is the northernmost of a series of four hydroelectric projects designed at the time to support the companyâ€™s Badin Works, a large aluminum smelting operation located 16 miles downstream in the community of Badin. At the time of construction,
    High Rock was the largest reservoir in North Carolina and one of the largest in the United States. With a healthy population of bass, crappie, catfish and stripers, High Rock Lake is a very fertile fishery. This productive, 15,180-acre lake in
    the north-central part of the state has 365 miles of shoreline. Whether you choose to fish from shore, or navigate these waters in a boat, canoe or kayak, you will have in front of you some of the best fishing water in the area. Marinas on the
    lake provide boaters goods and services to make your day on the lake a pleasure. Including, if you so desire, boat rentals. Fishing tackle, bait, groceries, beverages and ice are also available. The lake is lined with boat docks which provide
    cover for shallow bass and other species. There are plenty of creek channels, ledges, humps and drop-offs to fish when the fish move off the bank. The water is stained year round, so be prepared to fish spinnerbaits and flashy lures.</p>
