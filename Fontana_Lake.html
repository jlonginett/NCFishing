  <p>Fontana Lake is a reservoir impounded by Fontana Dam on the Little Tennessee River, and is located in Graham and Swain counties in North Carolina. The lake forms part of the southern border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the northern
    border of part of the Nantahala National Forest. Depending on water levels, the lake is about 17 miles (27 km) long. The eastern end is the Tuckasegee River near Bryson City. It has an average depth of 135 feet (41 m) and reaches a maximum depth
    of 440 feet (130 m), making it the deepest lake in North Carolina. The lake has many inlets into coves and many islands formed from former mountain peaks, especially near the eastern end. With over 230 miles of scenic shoreline, Fontana Lake
    offers a broad range of fishing opportunities. Well known as a bass tournament lake, it is home to bass over 10 pounds. Healthy populations crappie, perch, bluegill and walleye make this an excellent choice for fish-fry outings. If you like to
    fish for the big ones, the lake also boasts big catfish and muskie. If you prefer trout fishing, Fontana serves up both rainbow and brown trout. This 11,700-acre reservoir, located in the western part of the state, has a wide variety of camping
    and lodging choices. Public boat ramps and marinas make boating a pleasure, and boat rentals are available for varied types of boats. The lake has limited shoreline cover, but has a great deal of creek channels, coves, ledges and humps that hold
    fish - both deep and shallow, depending on time of year. There is limited shoreline access to much of the lake, but there are areas for fishing from shore. Boat, canoe, and kayak fishing are the preferred ways to fish these waters.</p>
