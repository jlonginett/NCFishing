  <p>Hybrid striped bass are typically found in large reservoirs of the southeast, where it has been stocked because of plentiful forage provided by gizzard shad and threadfin shad. This schooling fish which can be fun to catch, is quite good eating,
    and can also deplete a school of baitfish in very short order. It is a hybrid between a striped bass and a white bass which is found in warm- water systems with plenty of baitfish. Their ideal water temperature: 55° to 70°. Like stripers, when
    you catch one, you can be confident there are others nearby.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Adult stripers grow to giant sizes by eating lots of fish. The bigger they get, the larger the prey they can devour. Big baits for big fish is the appropriate approach when chasing stripers and wipers, especially if you want to catch a trophy.
    Fishing for stripers on medium to heavy rods, large capacity reels, stout line and big lures is the most popular approach. Choose a state to find local waters, tips, techniques and more.</p>
