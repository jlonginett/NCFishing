  <p>This 4,600-acre lake is perfect for an afternoon of kayaking, bird-watching, fishing, or just enjoy being outside. The Day Use Park offers a 17-acre lakefront area for public swimming (not life-guarded). The park is located at the southwest
    shore of the lake, so upon arrival and looking at the lake, follow the shoreline to the left. It also has walking trails, a beautiful playground, sand volleyball, a nine-hole disc golf course, horseshoe pits and a handicapped accessible fishing
    pier, plus picnic shelters, grills, restroom and concession facilities. The Roanoke Rapids Lake Park is also the best place to catch a beautiful sunrise or sunset over the water.</p>

  <p>The lake is situated downstream of Gaston Lake, in the northeast part of the state, at Roanoke Rapids, NC. Known for exceptional striped bass fishing in the fall, and generally good fishing all season long for a variety of species, it is a good
    choice for those who like to avoid crowds. There are day-use areas at the lake and campgrounds with RV spaces nearby. Come fish Roanoke Rapids Lake for big stripers and catfish, as well as load up the ice chest on crappie and perch. Multiple
    marinas offer services and supplies for boating, as well as boat rentals.</p>
