  <p>No private watercraft are allowed on Lake Benson. However there are rental boats with electric motors available at the Lake Benson Boat House. The lake covers 650 acres and has about 10 miles of shoreline. Fishing is allowed from the dock at no
    charge. Nice populations of bass, crappie, bream and catfish await fishing enthusiasts. This is a very picturesque setting and a great place to bring the family for a day of boating and fishing.</p>
