  <p>Lake Townsend, named in honor of James R. Townsend, City Manager of Greensboro from 1947-1961, is the largest of Greensboroâ€™s municipal reservoirs. The lake is 1,542 acres and is adjacent to the Bryan Park Complex and Golf Course off Highway 29
    North. The lake was built and open for recreation in 1969.</p>

  <p>A large boat ramp is available for private boat launching, with another launch ramp for small sailboats. Kayaks and rowboats are available to rent. Sailboats can be rented with previous sailing experience. The lake has a fishing pier, parking
    and restrooms that can be reasonably accessed by someone using a mobility device. There are over 34 miles of shoreline to explore in search of bass, catfish, crappie, sunfish, striped bass and wipers. An excellent boat ramp is open to the public
    for launch of canoes, kayaks, pontoons, pleasure boats and fishing boats of all kinds. There is a marina, the Lake Townsend Yacht Club, which is open to the public and offers boat rental. The nearest campground is about 15 miles south of the
    lake, which also has RV hookups.</p>

  <p>No swimming or wading is allowed at Lake Townsend or any of the Greensboro City Lakes.</p>
