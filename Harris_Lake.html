  <p>Harris Lake, or Shearon Harris Reservoir, is a reservoir in New Hill, North Carolina. The lake covers 4,100 acres (17 km2) in southwestern Wake County and southeastern Chatham County, located 220 feet above sea level. It is the source and outlet
    of cooling water for the Shearon Harris nuclear power plant. The lake is adjacent but not connected to B. Everett Jordan Lake. It was created by impounding Buckhorn Creek. There are two public boat ramps; one is near the southern end off North
    Carolina Highway 42, and the other near the northern end by Avent Ferry Road.</p>

  <p>Harris Lake County Park is located on the northeastern section of the lake. The park was leased to Wake County by Duke Energy in 1985, and opened to the public in 1999. The 680-acre park features five miles of hiking trails, almost eight miles
    of bike trails, and other amenities including picnic areas, a fishing pier, and a disc golf course. The park is home to several historic sites from an agricultural community, including the remains of the Womble, Smith, and Holleman households.
    However, those who fish this 4,100-acre reservoir in the northeast part of the state are rewarded with catches worthy of note. The lake contains a healthy population of bass, catfish, crappie, sunfish, white bass and northern pike. The primary
    targets here are bass and crappie. Bass over 10 pounds and crappie over 2 pounds swim in this lake. Nutrient-rich water with aquatic vegetation for cover makes this a very healthy fishery. Bring everything you need for your trip as the lake has
    little or no services for boating, fishing or camping. There are public boat ramps for easy launching.</p>
