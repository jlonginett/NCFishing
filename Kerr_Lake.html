  <p>Kerr Lake (aka Bugg's Island Lake) is a reservoir along the border of the U.S. states of North Carolina and Virginia. It is impounded by the John H. Kerr Dam, constructed between 1947 and 1952 to produce hydroelectricity and to provide flood
    control. Kerr Lake is owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers, and is the largest reservoir in Virginia. It is located in parts of Vance, Granville, and Warren counties in North Carolina, and Mecklenburg, Charlotte, and Halifax counties in
    Virginia. At its maximum capacity, it is one of the largest reservoirs in the Southeastern United States, covering approximately 50,000 acres (200 km2) and bordered by over 850 miles (1,370 km) of shoreline. If you enjoy catching a variety of
    species, Kerr Lake is a reservoir made to fulfill your dreams. While fishing for bass here, you may also catch white bass, perch, stripers, or crappie - all on the same lures. This 50,000-acre reservoir, located on the northern border of the
    state, has healthy populations of fish species including sunfish and plenty of bait fish. Pick your favorite stretch of the 850 miles of shoreline and wet a line. Fishing from boats, kayaks, canoes or from shore all produce ate this healthy
    fishery. During spring and fall the fish tend to favor shoreline areas, while moving deeper and schooling up during summer and winter. Locating schools of fish here may take some exploring, but once you do the action is likely to be hot and
    heavy. With marinas and campgrounds scattered around the lake you can easily locate most any services you require to enhance your stay.</p>
