  <p>The Northern Pike is also known as jack, jackfish, great northern pike and pickerel. Their ideal water temperature: 58° to 70°. The northern pike is a valiant fighter and prefers cool water temperatures. While they have been transplanted into
    most states with cold water, they are native to the northern states and are abundant in the northeastern states. Northern pike are basically olive in color with white and/or yellow bellies. The northern pike has light-colored marking on a dark
    body whish is opposite that of their cousins the muskies.They are an ambushing predator that eats frogs, crayfish, birds and virtually any fish they can get into their mouth. When fishing for northern pike use bright colored northern pike lures
    including spinners, fish-imitating lures, jerk-baits or cut bait and concentrate your fishing close to cover.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Northern pike hang around shallow weedy areas where they can ambush prey. In lakes without vegetation they follow schools of baitfish and/or sunfish, in and out of the shallows. Pike are cruisers whether they are around cover or in open water.
    If you are not getting bit right away, move on and try another area until you find them. They are voracious feeders and will eat anything they can catch. If you can locate them, and get their attention, you're likely to get hooked up.</p>

  <p><b>Fishing Shallow</b></p>
  <p>Begin your search by fishing shallow and focusing on weeds if they exist. Topwater lures allow you to cover a lot of water quickly, and will attract active fish. If they won't hit topwater lures, go to spinners, spinnerbaits, shallow crankbaits
    or swimbaits. Keep moving and switch up lures until you find the right area and the most effective lures.</p>

  <p><b>Mid Depths</b></p>
  <p>Focus your attention just outside weedy or shallow feeding areas. Crankbaits, jerkbaits, swimbaits or casting spoons are good choices here. You may have to slow down the presentation if the fish are not aggressive.</p>

  <p><b>Fishing Deep</b></p>
  <p>Begin your search in the deeper water, nearby shallow feeding areas. Experiment with depth until you locate willing participants. A fish finder can be very helpful here. Flutter spoons, deep diving crankbaits and bait (live bait where allowed)
    are good options.</p>

  <p><b>Trolling</b></p>
  <p>Anytime the fish move deeper than 8 or 10 feet, trolling is a good option. Boat speeds of 2 mph to nearly 3 mph seem to be most effective, and can vary with lure choice and rigging method. When northerns move deep they can hang out in waters 40
    or 50 feet deep, sometimes deeper. Identifying the depth can be made easier by trolling, as the depth of the lures can be controlled. Experiment until you identify the best depth range. Planer boards, downriggers and leaded line are options for
    deep trolling. Crankbaits, jerkbaits, deep divers, spoons and spinners can all be effective when trolling. Adding minnows, worms or cut bait can enhance your chance of getting bit, especially on slow days.</p>

  <p><b>Ice Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Ice fishing for northern pike is popular during winter on lakes that freeze over. It can also produce thrilling moments coaxing the big ones up through a hole in the ice.</p>

  <p>Northern pike primarily eat fish, but their diet often consists of many other food sources. Frogs, birds, crustaceans and most anything that moves in, or on the water. Bright colors, flash, vibration and commotion gets their attention. If they
    think it is edible, they will attack it. Pike have exceptionally sharp teeth, so for all lures, use a wire leader.</p>
