  <p>Lake Gaston is a hydroelectric reservoir in the eastern United States.  Part of the lake is in the North Carolina counties of Halifax, Northampton, and Warren. Lake Gaston is roughly 35 miles (56 km) long and covers over 20,000 acres (81 km2),
    with 350 miles (560 km) of shoreline.
    The area surrounding the lake is home to more than 150,000 residents. The nearest towns are Littleton and Roanoke Rapids in North Carolina. The lake is not federally owned. Lake Gaston has long been famous for fishing and other water recreations.
    The lake is a favorite vacation spot because it is close to the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, I-85, and I-95. Lake Gaston, built for flood control, hydroelectric power, and recreational enjoyment, includes such activities as
    fishing, boating, swimming, water skiing, and wakeboarding. Fast becoming "the lake" for big blue catfish, Lake Gaston has set the last three state records for blues. It is a 20,000-acre reservoir on the northern border of the state, 2 miles
    north of Littleton, NC. In addition to catfish, the lake has healthy populations of bass, crappie, walleye, stripers, white bass and chain pickerel. In fact, Lake Gaston served up the state record chain pickerel. Whether you want to catch a bunch
    of fish for a fish fry, or go in search of monster fish, Lake Gaston is a great destination for anglers. With over 350 miles of shoreline there is plenty of room for fishing from shore, or from your choice of boats, canoes and kayaks. Boat docks,
    creek channels and areas with aquatic vegetation are the primary targets for locating fish.</p>
