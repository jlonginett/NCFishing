  <p>Brook Trout prefer cold, clear water with current. Rocky streams are preferred. Ideal water temperature: 44° to 58°. Brook trout are the native trout of the US, originally found throughout areas with cold clean water, preferably waters which
    never exceed 68 degrees. As civilization invades its cool shady forest areas it causes the waters to warm and the brook trout population begins to diminish. Its primary food source is small insects, mollusks, crustaceans and other small fishes.
  </p>

  <p>Fishing for brook trout is the easiest of all the trouts. Look for gravel bottom streams with a moderate current, plenty of waterfalls and ponds which include rocks and cover. Overhanging trees offer additional shade, attract insects and offer
    protection from preying birds.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>When casting, the most common artificial lures used to catch trout are flies and spinner-type lures. Insects make up a large percentage of a trout's diet, particularly for small to medium size trout. Larger, more aggressive trout are more
    inclined to chase a lure imitating a minnow or other small fish.</p>

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Effective depth: 1' to 6'</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>JERKBAITS</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Effective depth: 1' to 6'</li>
    <li>Recommended line test: 4# to 8#</li>
    <li>Ideal conditions: Use jerkbaits when big trout, especially browns, are shallow and active.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Effective depth: Any depth</li>
    <li>Recommended line test: 2# to 6#</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>PREPARED BAITS</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Effective depth: Any depth</li>
    <li>Recommended line test: 2# to 6#</li>

  <p><b><ins>Trout Flies</ins></b></p>
  <p><b>TROUT FLIES</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Effective depth: Surface to 5'</li>
    <li>Recommended line: Fly fishing leader and tippet vary with fly size and fishing conditions.</li>
    <li>Ideal conditions: Use trout flies any time trout are feeding relatively shallow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Trout anglers use canned corn, marshmallows, cheese and a host of other edibles that will stay on a small hook.</p>
