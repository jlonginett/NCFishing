  <p>Kokanee are sockeye salmon which live their entire life in fresh water, not migrating to the ocean. Ideal water temperature: 48Â° to 58. Sockeye salmon which remain landlocked, never migrating to the ocean, are called kokanee salmon. Typically
    kokanee average one to two pounds. They are plankton feeders and very sensitive to water temperature. They school in lakes at depths which remain ideal temperatures. Once this depth is identified, schools can be found where they are easily
    caught.</p>
