  <p>The Warmouth Sunfish also known as goggle-eye, stumpknocker, mudgapper and warmouth bass. Ideal water temperature: 78° to 86°. The warmouth sunfish has a larger mouth than most sunfish and can eat larger prey. It is rather golden in color
    overall, darker greenish on the top side and lighter on the underside, with mottled spotting similar to a crappie. Adult warmouths feed on insects, mollusks, minnows and small fish. They prefer sandy bottoms of quiet areas in creeks, streams and
    rivers and look for heavy vegetation for cover. Fin to catch on ultra light tackle and quite a fight when you hook a fat little two ponder.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>They feed primarily on minnows, worms, small fish and crustaceans. All panfish eat pretty much anything edible they can get into their small mouths. Light line (2# to 4#) is a key to working the baits and improving catches. Using live minnows is
    a good way to attract the larger specimens. Earthworms, waxworms, nightcrawlers and insects (crickets, grasshoppers, etc.) are also good choices for all sizes.</p>
