  <h1><ins>Lake Mackintosh</ins></h1>

  <h2 style="text-align: left"><img src="https://d2qyesv2yl91ku.cloudfront.net/images/trip-reports/sdLM2.jpg"width="500" height="auto" /></h2>

  <p>With more than 1,150 acres and a shoreline of 61 miles, the lake offers guests the opportunity to enjoy a variety of outdoor activities including kayak, canoe and john boat rentals.</p>

  <p>The lake also offer numerous boat ramps for launching your own vessel and several areas to either fish on the pier or along the banks of the lake. Visitors can also enjoy the use of picnic sites and shelters for a relaxing and enjoyable
    gathering with friends and family. Kayak, canoe and john boats are available for rent. Renters must provide their own Coast Guard-approved life jacket/PFD and show it prior to renting.</p>

  <p>In addition, a Revolutionary War commemorative monument for the Battle of Clapp's Mill is located at the park overlooking the lake.</p>

  <p>As the primary water reserve for the City of Burlington, no swimming, wading or personal watercraft is permitted on the lake. This lake offers a nice variety of fish species. Some of the sixty miles of shoreline are accessible for fishing from
    the bank, but the majority of fish caught here are taken by anglers from a boat. Striped bass, hybrid stripers, crappie, catfish and bass all reside here in good numbers. Fishing tournaments are popular here, as are quiet fishing days from a
    canoe or kayak.</p>
