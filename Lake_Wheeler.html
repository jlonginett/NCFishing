  <p>Lake Wheeler Park is 150 acres of parkland and a 650-acre lake offering fishing, sailing, canoeing, rowing and kayaking. The Waterfront Program Center offers programs and classes, a small conference facility and concessions. Picnic facilities
    and sand volleyball also available. Many special events are held each year. Free admission; fee for boat launch and facility rental. Located on the southwest outskirts of Raleigh, NC. The seven miles of shoreline are wrapped in lush green trees,
    and are off limits to fishing from the bank. There are two fishing piers, which require a Lake Wheeler fishing permit - available at the park office. No permit is required for anglers fishing from boats. Canoes, kayaks, car-top boats, electric
    boats and power boats (with the exception os jet skis) are all permitted on the lake. Anglers can expect to catch bass, catfish and sunfish.</p>
