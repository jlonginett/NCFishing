  <p>Crappie are actually a member of the sunfish family and can be found in all the continental states. They are known by many different names- typically based on geographic location. Just to name a few you have Paper mouth, goggleye, bridge perch,
    and speckled perch. Following the seasonal movements of crappie will help to determine their location and how to catch them. Black Crappie prefers deep impoundments with fairly clear to slightly stained water with brush of trees for cover. There
    ideal water temperature is 66 to 76 degrees. The World record that was caught was 6 pounds and 0 ounces. This is the darker of the two species which has seven or eight dorsal spines and has spotted sides. They prefer larger, deeper impoundments.
    They can grow to over five pounds while three quarters of a pound to a pound is more typical.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Crappie feed year round. The feed during the morning, evening, and just after midnight. Crappie are a deep water species, except during the spawning period. They hang around brush or similar cover. When water temps are in the high 50’s to the
    low 70’s in spring triggers the spawning. Crappie stay in schools and hang around drop-offs. They feed on minnows, shrimp, insects and crustaceans. They prefer small, slow-moving baits, or live bait. These are schooling fish and can be caught by
    still-fishing, casting, trolling or drifting. Spring is the best season as they are involved in their spawning runs. The love cover, so locate brush, stumps or artificial cover, so locate brush, stumps or artificial cover at appropriate depths
    and you are likely to find crappie. At dawn you may find them close to the surface. As the sun hits the water they drop to 5 or 10 feet deep depending on water clarity. As the sun gets higher in the sky they may retreat to deeper water, 25 feet
    or more. As the sun begins to set they will move back up to the shallows and finish the day at the surface as dusk turns to darkness. Typically they return to deeper water for the night and may occasionally do some feeding during the dark hours.

  <p><b>During March - Early Spring</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crappie Activity: Moving slightly shallower in their migration toward the spawning areas.</li>
    <li>Location: 10 feet to 20 feet of water near drop offs with brush and cover.</li>
    <li>Tactics: Work slowly around the brush and cover with live minnows or jigs.</li>
    <li>Best Lures: Small jigs and minnows</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>April & May – Spring</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crappie Activity: All centered around the spawn.</li>
    <li>Location: 2 feet to 8 feet of water in coves and bays with brush and cover.</li>
    <li>Tactics: Identify the most active depth by experimenting. Use live minnows or jigs and move them slowly through the spawning area.</li>
    <li>Best Lures: Small jigs, minnows, spinners, and small crankbaits</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>June – Post Spawn</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crappie Activity: Recovering from the spawn</li>
    <li>Location: 10 feet to 20 feet of water near drop offs with brush and cover.</li>
    <li>Tactics: Find these drop offs outside the spawning areas. Use live minnows or jigs and move them extremely slowly. They will bite, but feeding is not the priority, resting is.</li>
    <li>Best Lures: Small jigs, minnows, spinners, and underspins</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>July & August – Summer</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crappie Activity: Holding in deeper water, around drop offs – ideally with brush.</li>
    <li>Location: 15 feet to 30 feet of water near drop offs with brush and cover. Also around boat houses with brush piles in 25 feet plus water.</li>
    <li>Tactics: Find drop offs and ledges near the river channel. Use live minnows, small jigging spoons or jigs and move them fairly slowly.</li>
    <li>Best Lures: Jigs, minnows, and jigging spoons</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>September & October – Autumn</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crappie Activity: Moving up from summer holding areas to shallower brush for feeding.</li>
    <li>Location: 5 feet to 20 feet of water with brush and cover. Also try boat houses, docks, and piers with brush piles.</li>
    <li>Tactics: Work around the brush and cover with live minnows, underspins or jigs, and move around until you locate schools.</li>
    <li>Best Lures: Jigs, minnows, spinners, and underspins</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>November, December, January & February – Winter</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crappie Activity: Holding in deeper water on ledges and near drop offs into the river channel. Timber, stumps, brush, and cover enhances the spot.</li>
    <li>Location: 20 feet to 40 feet of water with brush and cover. Often deeper in warmer lakes.</li>
    <li>Tactics: Finding the perfect depth is key, so experiment. Work extremely slow around the brush and cover with live minnows or jigs. Two bait rigs allow for testing two depths at the same time.</li>
    <li>Best Lures: Jigs, minnows, and jigging spoons</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Baits which imitate minnows, insects, worms or small crustaceans will attract them. The more aggressive they are, the faster you can move the bait in order to cover more water.</p>
