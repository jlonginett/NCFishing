  <p>Belews Lake is a reservoir in Stokes, Rockingham, Guilford and Forsyth counties of North Carolina, near the towns of Stokesdale and Pine Hall. The lake has a surface area of 3,864 acres (16 km2) and an 88-mile (142 km) shoreline. It is held back
    by a rolled earth dam and a concrete spillway. The northern portion of the lake commonly has depths of over 100 feet (30 m) and the lake reaches up to 130 feet (40 m) deep in the vicinity of the dam. Due to the warm water runoff from the power
    plant, Belews Lake maintains a warmer water temperature during winter than most other area lakes. As a result the growing season is extended for both predators and prey. This lake is, located in the northwest part of the state, has been both a
    boom and a bust during its storied history. Once the power plant resolved some issues years back, the lake has been on the rise as far as fishing goes. Bass and crappie are the primary species of choice, but the lake also has nice populations of
    white bass, catfish and sunfish. Don't be afraid to fish deep here (down to 50 feet or more) as the clear water often drives the bulk of the fish away from the shallows. At the same time, there may also be fish extremely shallow even in clear
    water. Boat ramps, boat rental, marinas, restaurant, store, campgrounds and lodging are all available at the lake.</p>
