  <p>The Large Mouth Bass prefers slightly stained to murky water with cover and minimal current, in depths from one foot to sixty feet. Ideal water temperature: 60 to 80 degrees. This fish is also known as the bucket mouth. This fish has a mouth
    that opens wide enough to swallow its own head. The world record that has been caught was 22 pounds and 5 ounces. It will attempt to eat virtually anything it can catch and swallow.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p><b>Spring Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Spinnerbaits, crankbaits, jerkbaits, and soft plastics.
    Fish shallow to moderate depths as the bass moves into spawning coves and flats in search of food, seeking warmer water, and preparing for the spawn. Try shallow-water flippin on cloudy days or in murky water.</p>

  <p><b>Summer Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Top water lures, crankbaits, Jigs and plastic worms.
    Fish shallow in the mornings and evenings and move deeper as the sun rises. “Deep” depends on the overall depth of the lake you are fishing. In some lakes you may need to go as deep as 60 feet while others seldom hold fish below 25 feet.
    Largemouth's bass often feed heavily at night during the hot summer months.</p>

  <p><b>Fall Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Spinnerbaits, crankbaits, and spoons.
    Fish shallow to moderate depths in the mornings and evenings. As the bass move deeper during the day move to outside deep structure and use spoons or jigs. Key on schools of bait as the bass will be nearby the food source.</p>

  <p><b>Winter Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Jigs, pork baits and soft plastics.
    Try shallow in the mornings then move deeper as the sun rises. Bass are not very active in cold water, so move your bait in a slow, easy to catch manner and fish deep cover and structure. “Deep” depends on the overall depth of the lake you are
    fishing. In some lakes you may need to go as deep as 60 feet while others seldom hold fish below 35 feet. They have daily migrations – from feeding areas to deeper holding areas. Figuring out the timing of this movement is a key to increasing
    your daily catch.</p>
