  <p>They’re excellent fighters on any test of line, though hooking into them with light line promises to put up battles remembered for many years to come. Identification: the single best way to begin identifying steelhead is to count the rays on the
    anal fin. The rays should be 12 or less. Steelhead have a white mouth and gum line. There is a distinctive red to pink band that follows the length of the lateral line from the head to the tail during spawning season. When they’re not in the
    spawning stages steelhead are predominately chrome. Spots run the length of the body but are prominently displayed along the back from the head to the tail. Depending on the region, the color of the top of the head can be light to deep olive
    green. The average weight of a steelhead is subjective, the further north you go the longer fish live, but tend to be smaller than their southern counterparts. The world record for steelhead is constantly debated, but most anglers, guides, and
    scientists agree on 42-pounds.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Steelhead will feed on squid, copepods, crustaceans, and smaller baitfish such as sand-lance and smelt. Though salmon can often be found holding in the same area they will often not take the same baits or lures. Steelhead prefer spinners fished
    very deep or they will hit small zingers and buzz-bombs that are fished deep but slowly. Scent and cover is the thing to remember when fishing for them in the estuary. Don’t fish for them from shore without getting into the water at least knee
    high to hide yourself from sight. Fisherman who fish from the shoreline are often seen by this elusive fish because they are higher than the waterline and that makes them easy to see and it will be enough to put any fish in the area off the bite.
    The best way to fight a steelhead is pretty much the same way you would in a river; they’re every bit as acrobatic in the estuary and that’s what makes them so hard to land. In an estuary they have room to run and flail about but one of the first
    things they tend to do is head for the nearest structure and if there’s nothing in the water for them to head for then you’re the next best thing and they’ll head straight for you at top speed. As it streaks towards you reel and walk backwards at
    the same time until it turns. As it runs make sure to “palm or thumb” the spool to give maximum tension on the line, but only for a few seconds at a time. Don’t reel against the drag. Each time it jumps lower the rod tip into the water to take up
    any slack, the moment it is back in the water put your rod tip back up high and play it out. Typically, when a steelhead has done all it can to throw the hook it will come in relatively easy but be prepared for the fish to bolt the second you
    attempt to tail or net it. “Cover” is the key to finding steelhead, but drop-offs are an excellent place for holding steelhead too.</p>
