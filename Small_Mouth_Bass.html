  <p>The Smallmouth Bass prefers rocky areas of clear to slightly stained water in depths from one foot to fifty feet, with or without current. The ideal water temperature would be between 58 to 72 degrees. The World record is 10 pounds and 14 ounces
    caught. While the smallmouth only grows to about half the size of the largemouth bass. It is much more agile, faster and powerful for its size. It eats pretty much the same foods, just smaller specimens. It is without argument one of the finest
    game fish and angler can pursue. The smallmouth, aka smallie, bronzeback, brown bass, and brownie, feed primarily on crustaceans, insects, crayfish, smaller fish and baitfish. They are also quite comfortable in current. The smallies migrate to
    deep waters and basically hibernate during coldest seasons of winter. During these times they are difficult to catch. Small baits, worked very slowly are often the only way to provoke a strike. In warmer water they can feed quite aggressively and
    will readily take crankbaits, spinnerbaits, topwater lures, jigs, worms and most baits that resemble baitfish or crawfish.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p><b>Spring Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Spinnerbaits, crankbaits, jigs, and soft plastics.
    Fish shallow to moderate depths as the smallmouth move into the shallows for warmer water, spawning and food source activity. Gravel points and submerged humps are prime holding areas.</p>

  <p><b>Summer Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Crankbaits, Jigs, top water and plastic worms.
    Fish shallow in the mornings and evenings and move deeper as the sun rises. Use lures that mimic crawfish or shad as these are favorite foods for smallmouths. Follow points and rocky or gravel structure deeper until you establish the proper
    depth. Reefs with deep water nearby are prime targets. Smallmouth often feed at night during the hot summer months.</p>

  <p><b>Fall Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Spinnerbaits, crankbaits, and spoons.
    Fish shallow to moderate depths in the mornings and then again late in the afternoon after the sun has been on the water and warmed the shallows. As the bass move deeper concentrate on deeper structure and use jigs, worms and spoons.</p>

  <p><b>Winter Fishing</b></p>
  <p>Top Baits: Jigs, pork baits and plastic worms.
    No reason to be on the water at the break of day. If anything, later in the day may be the most active for fishing shallow as these areas warm from the sun. Smallmouth are less active in cold water, so move your bait in a slow, easy to catch
    manner. Fish shallow feeding areas first. But if they are not shallow concentrate on deeper structure. “Deep” depends on the overall depth of the lake you are fishing. In some lakes you may need to go as deep as 60 feet while others seldom hold
    fish below 45 feet. They often suspend in open water just outside the structure they use. During the spawning season look for them to nest deeper than largemouths. Water clarity dictates the depth as they choose areas where sunlight will
    penetrate to warm the eggs. Female smallies can lay more than twenty thousand eggs. After dropping the eggs, the female moves to deeper water to recover while the male guards the nest.</p>
