  <p>Pumpkinseeds are also known as punky or common sunfish. Ideal water temperature: 75° to 82°. Pumpkinseed sunfish are shaped like a pumpkin seed and often has body coloring similar to a pumpkin color, their favorite habitat is weed-covered lake
    bottoms in clear water. They prefer warmer water temperatures from mid seventies to low eighties. Fish for them on light tackle with small hooks using worms, insects, prepared bait and cut bait.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Sunfish feed primarily on minnows, worms, small fish and crustaceans. All panfish eat pretty much anything edible they can get into their small mouths. Light line (2# to 4#) is a key to working the baits and improving catches. Using live minnows
    is a good way to attract the larger specimens. Earthworms, waxworms, nightcrawlers and insects (crickets, grasshoppers, etc.) are also good choices for all sizes.</p>

  <p><b><ins>BEST LURES:</ins></b></p>
  <p><b>SMALL JIGS</b></p>
  <p>Use small jigs in light weights, 1/64 oz to 1/4 oz for all depths, water conditions and seasons.</p>

  <p><b>SMALL SPINNERS</b></p>
  <p>Use small spinners for shallow, active fish.</p>

  <p><b>MINI SPOONS</b></p>
  <p>Use mini spoons 1/8 oz to 1/4 oz when fish are in deeper water.</p>

  <p><b>UNDERSPINS</b></p>
  <p>Use small underspins in shallow to mid-depth water.</p>

  <p><b>MINI CRANKBAITS</b></p>
  <p>Use mini crankbaits in shallow water.</p>

  <p><b>SALMON EGGS</b></p>
  <p>Use salmon eggs for all panfish fishing conditions.</p>

  <p><b>WORMS</b></p>
  <p>Use worms, nightcrawlers or wax worms for all panfish fishing conditions.</p>

  <p><b>PREPARED BAITS</b></p>
  <p>Use prepared baits for all panfish fishing conditions.</p>

  <p>Pumpkinseed Sunfish diet consists of zooplankton, insects, worms, small fishes, fish larvae, fish eggs, crustaceans and virtually any live creature they can get in their mouth. This group of smaller species eat the same diet as the larger
    species, just smaller in size. Smaller lures and hooks are required to catch these smaller panfish.</p>
