  <p>Randleman Lake is a reservoir on the Deep River in Randolph and Guilford Counties in central North Carolina, extending from just northwest of Randleman to east of High Point. The lake was created in 2004 with the construction of the Randleman
    Lake Dam. The lake was created to satisfy the drinking water needs of the greater Greensboro area for the next 50 years, as well as to provide recreational opportunity.</p>

  <p>Located on the southern outskirts of Greensboro, Randleman Lake is the new hot spot for bass in NC. Bass and crappie are plentiful and, and bass over ten pounds are already being caught. There are over 100 miles of shoreline for anglers to scout
    in search of shallow fish. Deep channels, ledges and humps attract bass and crappie alike during the warmest months, and again during the colder months. Anglers are restricted to fishing from boats, except a few designated areas and the fishing
    pier. There are several options for camping and lodging within 30 minutes (or less) from the lake. Convenience stores, gas, bait shops and restaurants are all close by. There is a nice boat launch ramp at the marina, which also offers boat
    rentals.</p>
