  <p>Lake Chatuge which is nestled in the mountains of Western North Carolina. In 1942, the TVA constructed a 2,950-foot earth-and-rock dam across the Hiawassee River, forming Lake Chatuge. Visitors enjoy leisurely strolls along the dam with its
    spectacular view of the lake and surrounding mountains. With more than 130 miles of shoreline, the lake has numerous finger-like projections of land forming interesting coves for great fishing, swimming, boating and water sports. With three kinds
    of bass, Chatuge Lake is a great destination for bass anglers. This is a 7,480-acre lake in the southwest corner of the state with excellent amenities to make an outing here a pleasant experience. Boat rentals are available at marinas for power
    boats, canoes and kayaks. Fishing from shore is also a viable option here, with some day-use areas providing over a mile of shoreline for fishing. Rocky banks, some with stumps and laydowns offer cover to bass. There are also many boat docks
    which often create ideal hangouts for bass, crappie and sunfish. There are plenty of ledges and submerged humps around the lake for structure fishing, and those located near deeper creek channels often produce fish fairly consistently. Because
    the lake is located in both Georgia and North Carolina, fishing regulations for both states come into play. Check fishing regulations for specific rules regarding this reservoir, before wetting a line.</p>
