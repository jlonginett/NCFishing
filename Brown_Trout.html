  <p>The brown trout can tolerate slightly warmer waters than the brook trout and have taken over some of the fisheries formerly inhabited by the brookies. It is much more wary than other trouts which help ensure its longevity in waters where other
    trouts are fished out. It prefers clear to slightly stained water with little or no current. Ideal water temperature: 45° to 62°. When brown trout fishing look for quiet water with lots of cover. Logs, under cuts in the bank, rock shelves,
    overhanging trees and brush are some of the brown trouts favorite hiding places. The larger they get, the more wary they get and become more inclined to feed at night under the protection of darkness.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Brown trout feed on worms, minnows, insects and crustaceans. Dry fly fishing for pan-sized browns is a favorite technique as they rise well to these crafty presentations. Larger browns tend to feed more on flesh and favor nutritious crustaceans,
    worms or small fishes.</p>

  <p>Trout anglers use canned corn, marshmallows, cheese and a host of other edibles that will stay on a small hook.</p>
