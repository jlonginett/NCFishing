  <p>Striped Bass are found in fresh water systems that drain into the ocean, as well as reservoirs stocked with stripers. Their ideal water temperature: 55° to 65°. Once it was known that they could survive in fresh water they were introduced into
    fresh water impoundments as a test, where they survived and flourished. Often to the extent of eating the local species out of house and home. They will eat anything that swims. As a schooling fish which can grow to enormous size they can deplete
    a school of baitfish in very short order. When you catch a striper you can rest assured that there are others close by.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Adult stripers grow to giant sizes by eating lots of fish. The bigger they get, the larger the prey they can devour. Big baits for big fish is the appropriate approach when chasing stripers and wipers, especially if you want to catch a trophy.
    Fishing for stripers on medium to heavy rods, large capacity reels, stout line and big lures is the most popular approach.</p>
