  <p>Flatheads are caught primarily on bait like live shiners and chubs and only occasionally on cut or prepared baits. They are the second largest of the catfishes and lie in cover of submerged logs or other large structures. Prime fishing time for
    catching them is after dark. Flathead Catfish prefer streams or large bodies of slightly stained to murky water with moderate current and hard bottom. Ideal water temperature: 75° to 84°.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>The best catfish baits are those that appeal to the cat's sense of smell and/or taste. These wiskered critters can identify food sources from 100 feet away or more. Natural scents derived from resident food sources can trigger a natural
    arrtaction. Many prepared baits incorporate these natural flavors into the mix, and/or add other scents known to appeal to catfish. Flathead catfish, especially the big ones, tend to prefer live fish.</p>

  <p><b><ins>Top 5 Catfish Baits</ins></b></p>
  <p>If it resembles food in any way and emits an odor, it is likely to attract the interest of these cats. The most effective baits are those that convince them it's edible.</p>

  <p><b>1. Worms</b></p>
  <p>As natural as it can get, a big gob of earthworms, night crawlers or catalpa worms probably catch more cats than any other bait. When worms are not working, it could be the wrong area, or you may have to tempt them with more potent baits.</p>

  <p><b>2. Frogs & Other Critters</b></p>
  <p>Frogs, salamanders, shrimp, snakes, mice, birds and other rodents that wander into catfish turf are likely to become a meal. Frogs and salamanders are the easiest to rig.</p>

  <p><b>3. Crayfish</b></p>
  <p>Crawdads are fair game for any fish big enough to swallow them, and a favorite of catfish. Live or dead crayfish will catch cats.</p>

  <p><b>4. Live Fish & Cut Bait</b></p>
  <p>Catfish happily devour any fish they can capture and swallow. Minnows, sunfish and smaller gamefish are the most common. Check local regulations. Some waters do not allow fishing with live bait. Some allow live bait if it is captured in the same
    body of water. In areas where fishing with live fish is prohibited, try cut bait.</p>
