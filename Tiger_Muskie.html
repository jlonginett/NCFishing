  <p>The tiger muskellunge is a cross of the musky and northern pike. Ideal water temperature: 58° to 70°. Male Tiger Muskellunge are most often sterile yet some females are fertile. Tiger muskies tend to be smaller than non-hybrid muskies but grow
    very fast. The body is often quite silvery with brownish fins and tail, without spots but displays broken vertical markings. Like their parent, they eat any fish they can catch and prefer to ambush their prey. They also eat crayfish, frogs and
    birds. Use large lures and stout line when fishing for tiger muskellunge. They will hit lures and fresh cut bait. They are known for their speed and are exceptionally strong for short runs. Tiger muskie typically inhabit swallow areas of lakes
    and rivers, hanging around outside weed edges and under cover of submerged vegetation. During the summer, when water temperatures warm, large tiger muskies move to cooler and hold on structure. If natural springs are present they are inclined to
    stay near this cooler water.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Heavy duty, rods, reels, line, leaders and lures are in order when muskie fishing. Level wind reels with 50# to 80# braid, on a 7' heavy action rod is a good place to start. At any time you could hook a monster. Live bait (where legal) and cut
    bait are also good options to consider.
    Dawn and dusk are often the most active hours of the day. Spring and Fall are top seasons for musky. Summer, in colder climates, can also produce good catches. Most muskie waters freeze over in winter, some of which are legal for catching muskie
    through the ice. Tiger Muskie primarily eat fish, but their diet also consists of many other food sources. Frogs, birds, crustaceans and most anything that moves in, or on the water is subject to being eaten by these large predators. Big lures,
    bright colors, flash, vibration and commotion peak their interest. If they think it is edible, they will most likely attack. These pike have exceptionally sharp teeth, so for whatever lure you choose, use a wire leader.</p>
