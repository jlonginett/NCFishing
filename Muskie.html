  <p>Muskie are the largest of the pike family, they are found in about half the states. Ideal water temperature: 55° to 70°. Muskie are found primarily the northern and northeastern states. They prefer clear water lakes and streams. Also known as
    musky, muskie and great pike, they eat any fish they can catch and prefer to ambush their prey. They also eat crayfish, frogs and birds.Use large lures (salt-water sizes) and heavy line when fishing for muskellunge. They are known for their speed
    and are exceptionally strong for short runs. They will hit large musky lures and fresh cut bait.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Muskie primarily eat fish, but their diet also consists of many other food sources. Frogs, birds, crustaceans and most anything that moves in, or on the water is subject to being eaten by these large predators. Big lures, bright colors, flash,
    vibration and commotion peak their interest. If they think it is edible, they will most likely attack. These pike have exceptionally sharp teeth, so for whatever lure you choose, use a wire leader.</p>
