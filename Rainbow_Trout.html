  <p>Known for its tasty pink flesh, beauty and gameness, rainbows are a favorite among the vast majority of anglers. It also appeals to the fly fisherman as it can be tempted to take properly presented flies as well as other baits and lures. It
    feeds on small insects, minnows, crustaceans and worms. It is ideal for both sport and dining pleasure. It prefers slightly stained to clear water with or without current. Ideal water temperature: 45° to 60°. Originally found in the Rockies and
    west to the Pacific ocean, it has been distributed far and wide across the US. It tends to do better in the northeast but is found in isolated areas even in the south. In waters that allow such migration the rainbow trout will remain in streams
    until it reaches 6" to 9" in length and then travel to lakes or oceans where it will bulk up and then return to the streams or rivers to spawn.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>When casting, the most common artificial lures used to catch trout are flies and spinner-type lures. Insects make up a large percentage of a trout's diet, particularly for small to medium size trout. Larger, more aggressive trout are more
    inclined to chase a lure imitating a minnow or other small fish.</p>
