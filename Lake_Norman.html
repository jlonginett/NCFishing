  <p>Located 20 miles north of Charlotte, Lake Norman is the perfect place for a quick trip or small getaway anytime of the year. Stroll down the historic main streets lined with a fun mix of boutique shops, galleries and restaurants or experience
    the beautiful scenery by boating and fishing or hiking and biking. As North Carolina’s largest man-made lake, there’s something for everyone to love with plenty to do for a relaxing escape or outdoor adventure. </p>

  <p>A 32,000-acre nationally known as a bass fishing haven, Lake Norman offers much more, with a wide variety of fishing and other water sport opportunities. This reservoir is located in the north-central part of the state, at Mooresville. In
    addition to healthy populations of bass, there are enormous schools of perch, crappie and striped bass roaming these waters. Catfish and sunfish round out the list of species available. For boaters, there are multiple places around the lake to
    launch. Anglers wishing to fish from shore can pick a spot from over 500 miles of shoreline around this lake with plenty of coves, pockets and points. Fishing from a boat allows anglers to fish around the deep channels and ledges, as well as fish
    the shallows in the backs of coves and incoming creek. The lake is lined with boat docks, which provide shade and cover for the fish. Canoe and kayak fishing are popular here, including organized kayak bass tournaments being held with some
    frequency.</p>
