  <p>Lighter in color, it has six dorsal spines, has eight or nine vertical bands on its sides and is found primarily in the southern states, and prefers quiet backwaters. Whites are often found in murkier waters.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>These are schooling fish and can be caught by still-fishing, casting, trolling or drifting. Spring is the best season as they are involved in their spawning runs. They love cover, so locate brush, stumps or artificial cover at appropriate depths
    and you are likely to find crappie. At dawn you may find them close to the surface. As the sun hits the water they drop to 5 or 10 feet deep depending on water clarity. As the sun gets higher in the sky they may retreat to deeper water, 25 feet
    or more. As the sun begins to set they will move back up to the shallows and finish the day at the surface as dusk turns to darkness. Typically they return to deeper water for the night and may occasionally do some feeding during the dark hours.

  <p>Baits which imitate minnows, insects, worms or small crustaceans will attract them.</p>
