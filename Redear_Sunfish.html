  <p>The redear sunfish is also known as stumpknocker and shellcracker and grows larger than most sunfish. Ideal water temperature: 70° to 80°. The redear sunfish can be found throughout the warmer states. It is typically yellowish on the sides,
    white on the belly and dark green or brown on the top side. The red stripe along the edge of the ear (opercle) is the distinguishing mark for males, and it is orange on females. The usual sunfish baits like worms and grubs work well on light line
    with small hooks. Rarely doe the redear sunfish rise to take flies and baits off the surface.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Redear Sunfish feed primarily on minnows, worms, small fish and crustaceans. All panfish eat pretty much anything edible they can get into their small mouths. Light line (2# to 4#) is a key to working the baits and improving catches. Using live
    minnows is a good way to attract the larger specimens. Earthworms, waxworms, nightcrawlers and insects (crickets, grasshoppers, etc.) are also good choices for all sizes.</p>
