  <p>Mountain Island Lake is fed by the Catawba River, and is the smallest of the three man-made lakes that border Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (Lake Norman, and Lake Wylie). Mountain Island Lake is managed by Charlotte-based company Duke
    Energy. The primary function of Mountain Island Lake is to provide drinking water for over 1 million residents of Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County, as well as Mount Holly and Gastonia in Gaston County. The lake is also accessible to
    the public for boating and fishing use. There are three boating access areas on the lake and a tailrace fishing platform for bank fishing in cooperation with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Full pond elevation is approximately
    647.5 feet (197 m). The lake has around 3,281 acres (13 km2) of surface area and 61 miles (98 km) of shoreline. This is a 3,200-acre reservoir in the southwest part of the state which offers respectable bass, catfish, crappie and perch fishing.
    Lots of finger channels and bays around the lake are lined with boat docks - many of which have brush piles as crappie attractors. Bass tend to hang around these food sources. Learning which docks have this cover may be the key to a successful
    day of fishing for bass or crappie.</p>
