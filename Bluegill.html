  <p>Bluegill prefer slightly stained to murky water with little or no current. Survives in most warm fisheries. Ideal water temperature: 60° to 85°. Other names for bluegills include common yellow perch, sunfish, red-breasted bream, red-spotted
    sunfish, long-eared sunfish, white bass as well as a host of variations and cross breeds. These fish tend to run in schools and congregate near their food supply. They can be found in depths of 35 feet or more and all the way up to the surface
    depending on time of day and weather conditions. Bluegill spend the majority of their active time in 1 to 10 foot depths.</p>

  <h2><ins>List of Best Lures and Bait to use:</ins></h2>

  <p>Bluegill feed primarily on minnows, worms, small fish and crustaceans. All panfish eat pretty much anything edible they can get into their small mouths. Light line (2# to 4#) is a key to working the baits and improving catches. Using live
    minnows is a good way to attract the larger specimens. Earthworms, waxworms, nightcrawlers and insects (crickets, grasshoppers, etc.) are also good choices for all sizes.</p>

  <p><b><ins>BEST LURES:</ins></b></p>
  <p><b>SMALL JIGS</b></p>
  <p>Use small jigs in light weights, 1/64 oz to 1/4 oz for all depths, water conditions and seasons.</p>

  <p><b>SMALL SPINNERS</b></p>
  <p>Use small spinners for shallow, active fish.</p>

  <p><b>MINI SPOONS</b></p>
  <p>Use mini spoons 1/8 oz to 1/4 oz when fish are in deeper water.</p>

  <p><b>UNDERSPINS</b></p>
  <p>Use small underspins in shallow to mid-depth water.</p>

  <p><b>MINI CRANKBAITS</b></p>
  <p>Use mini crankbaits in shallow water.</p>

  <p><b>SALMON EGGS</b></p>
  <p>Use salmon eggs for all panfish fishing conditions.</p>

  <p><b>WORMS</b></p>
  <p>Use worms, nightcrawlers or wax worms for all panfish fishing conditions.</p>
